For the last 6 years, I have been interested in writing and sharing my thoughts. I have written tens of drafts for articles that I think are useful, worth reading, and interesting to others, or at least to my young self. However, I haven't published them because I feel that I haven't provided enough evidence, my writing might sound naive, or even don't feel qualified to write on those topics because I am not a (world) expert on them. This bothered me a lot that I have kept writing on my [Obsidian vault](https://notes.FarisHijazi.com) (only a few have access to it) just to keep the momentum running.

Therefore, I have decided that I will write something every Sunday and publish it about any topic that interests me. I will use [Notion page](https://notion.FarisHijazi.com) to redirect to my Notion page for my weekly logs. The reason why I am using a separate page/subdomain for my weekly logs because I want to have my polished work to be on my main domain, [FarisHijazi](https://FarisHijazi.com), whereas, my half-baked but useful/interesting work on a separate domain, [Notion page](https://notion.FarisHijazi.com).

Here is what you should expect that I will be talking about:
- Weekly overview of what I have consumed/learned throughout the week and include relevant resources.
- Progress updates for certain goals to keep me accountable while showing others what I am doing.
- Random thoughts about topics that I have been thinking of for some time.

I hope that I will find this way to share what I know while still being useful to others and not stressful to me. Happy new year!
